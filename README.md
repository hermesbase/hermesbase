## About the project name
According to the ancient Greek religion and mythology Hermes functions as the emissary and messenger of the gods. Hermes plays the role of the psychopomp or "soul guide"—a conductor of souls into the afterlife. He is also considered the protector of human heralds, travelers, merchants, and orators. The Latin word 'conveyance' is a combination of 'con-' (together) and 'vehere' (to carry). The original sense of 'conveyance' referred to the act of physically transporting or carrying something from one place to another. Over time, its meaning expanded to encompass the idea of transmitting or transferring ideas, messages, or information.
